## Rules

Lab slots do not require mandatory presence.

To pass the course, the student has to collect 4 grades:
* the grades are in category: "presentation", "demo", "essay", "competition entry", "open" (choose four out of them, at most one in the same category, it is not necessary to cover everything)
* the student proposes a category and a topic, which is discussed and accepted by the TA. The proposal is made as a pull-request on this repository.
* in each category, there are suggested topics, listed on issues in this repository (for instance [#9](https://github.com/KTH/devops-course/issues/9) lists topics about testing)
* each grading category, there is a grading form, which explains how to pass / pass with distinction.
* 4 Pass means a final E, 3 Pass / 1 Distinction means a final D, 2 Pass / 2 Distinction means a final C, 1 Pass / 3 Distinction means a final B, 4 Distinction means a final A
  * for the competition, the distinction is given to the top-25% best performing teams
* the grades are announced as a pull-request or issue comment on this repository.   
* Group work is encouraged (max 3 persons) but you cannot be with the same persons for more than 2 projects. You can do a work alone for one or at most two projects.
* A failed task requires to pass it again at the end of the course, based on the feedback from the failure. A repeated task cannot be passed with distinction. A task can only be repeated once.
* If the whole course is failed, no grades are kept if the student registers again to the course the year after. 

Group Rules
* The pre-generated group sheets are the suggestion instead of the mandatory.
* When you send a pull for registration, please follow the name convention of using email addresses of two members: email-email instead of the group number.
* We recommend 2 students. Three is also possible for ambitious essays, demos or development.
