# Week 1

we are happy to spend 4 intensive hours with you to discuss DevOps. Here is some update for those who did not come to the course. 
*  The pre-generated group sheets are the suggestion instead of the mandatory.
*  We have decided to drop the numbering of the groups due to poor maintainable. So there is no need to create an issue to update the group sheet.
 * When you send a pull for registration, please follow the name convention of using email addresses of two members: email-email instead of the group number.
* We added four folders under the presentation corresponding to four slots of presentations, please add your pull request to the correct folder.
